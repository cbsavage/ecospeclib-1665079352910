JUPITER MOON RESEARCH W/ KARALIDI

the thing: 55942

EXAMPLE old name: water.snow.mediumgranular.medium.all.medgran_snw_.jhu.becknic.spectrum.txt
new name: medium.granular.snow

WE'RE LOOKING AT:
       surface properties
       how reflection changes
       galilean moons

!!!DO NOT USE RM AT ALL!!!

Planet Science JC: PSB 160

google scholar is another good resource for literature research

aster > data > spectral library > ecostress > download

flip data, rename file, upload *again*
greatest to least => least to greatest
salinities affecting spectrum
Python code to change name for me
use import OS 

1/17/23:
REVIEW CLASS NOTES TO DO BELOW:
make list with all file names open w load txt skip row and read data and save with new name np.save.txt

command try except

some nerd shit: io and europa > all other jovian moons

"math speak" - dr kaden, 2023

IMPORT MATPLOTLIB on py doc



5/2/23:
to find which surfaces align better with the graphs 
could blend surfaces

5/26/23:
should spectra be included in paper if i write one??
Europa: ice, frost?
Ganymede: sulfur?, ice, frost?
Callisto: ice, frost?
Io: sulfur, igneous

5/31/23:
do i make spectral graphs for different areas on surface or entire surface??
is only one paper enough to find surface composition???? most likely
is reflectance info important?? YES

7/16/23:
calcium chloride
sulfuric acid
ammonia
dry or hydrous silicates
iron core most likely

Io: sort thru silicates to find igneous ones


7/19/2023:
rhyolite
dacite
quatrz andesite


7/30/23:
snows:
fine: 1
medium: 2
coarse: 3

fix environment, email kenny for environment files

surface_input.py in downloads is original, i will fix the one in Stokes and see what happens


  File "surface_input.py", line 26, in <module>
    for i in range( uniq ):
TypeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

note: look over structure of .py file
find out how dap.in will look like so it runs
find out how tf the for loop can just go through each file name instead of each LETTER in the file names

make sure dap.in 
- in script: its submitting srfc in dap.in instead of surface itself
- adjust script so it includes quotes " or ' in name
- thought it ran but it crashed??

# issue isn't with script, issue is with file that reads my data or smth
# NEVERMIND, IT WAS THE FILE I TRIED TO RUN
WAHOOOOOOOO
it turns out ALL files need to be least > greatest (maybe not)

# adjust script so it reads "folder/file_name"

# matters if file name has quotations around it
# LS -1 IS MY BEST FRIEND
ls -1 * > *insert name of file ur creating*
# adjust script so it adds files it ran to separate folder

# ls -1 and pipe into folder
# change with listing of folder i'm working with
# list folder name
# once folder is done
# in os.listdir() code block, make folder for files that were previously run and move repeated files to that folder

# add lines in fortran line 
(so it doesn't crash)
# my issue is the naming of fourier file?? (maybe??)
# save more space for fourext1
also need to save space for longest name :)
find biggest name i renamed and change fourext1 so it makes enough space for it
# go to headers define memory, change how many characters allowed for fourext1
# make sure they all have same number
# DAP/main.f at the header
# GAP/adding.f
# DISK/disk.f

'/' will make the fourier file freak out
easiest solution would be 
out_d
# call the os
# move fourext files into output file
main.f, move (abv)
disk.f, : 

gap: go into main.f and add line to move four file to output file
adding.f

ASK KENNY FOR all files

os = CALL SYSTEM

subroutine = function in fortran
double presc = float64

go thru all files for memory allocated for longest name
in fourext,
four_1, four_2

longest character title possible plus fourier file name

example: 10 for folder+file name and 30 for fourier file
