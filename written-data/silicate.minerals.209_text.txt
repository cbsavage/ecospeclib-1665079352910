Name: Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Cyclosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: beryl_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Maine via Hunt and Salisbury Collection sample#180B (purchased from Ward's Natural Science Establishment).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The hand sample was cut and polished along an unknown axis.  It was pale green and appeared pure.  Microscopic examination showed a small amount (2% or less) of very fine, low birefringent material in the sample.  The contaminating grains occasionally have rhombic or cubic shape.  These grains were unidentifiable. Sampled measured was polished surface. (Ring Silicates) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.cyclosilicate.solid.beryl1.spectrum.txt
