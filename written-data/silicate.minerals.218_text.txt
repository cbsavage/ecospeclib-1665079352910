Sample No.: smectite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Grant Co., Washington, USA via the Clay Mineral SocietySource Clay Mineral Repository #CMS SWa-1
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  Described by CMS as a ferruginous smectite, the sample was a brown, earthy clay. The less than 2 micrometers size fraction is pure Fe-smectite (probably nontronite).  The larger size fraction contains a small amount of quartz and was discarded.(Sheet silicates); Smectite GroupSample particle size was less than 2  Micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.powder.smecti1.spectrum.txt
