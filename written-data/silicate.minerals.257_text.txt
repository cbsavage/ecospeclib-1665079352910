Name: Grossular Ca3Al2(Si04)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: grossul_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Pear Gillis Farm, Beach Glen, Buncombe Co.,North Carolina via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 155371).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a spherical cluster of small crystals about 1.5 cm in diameter.  Green interstitial material, probably diopside, occurred between many small brown euhedral crystals of grossular, which were hand-picked from the crushed sample.  Under the petrographic microscope, a very small amount of alteration of grossular crystals was seen. Particle size was Less than 2 Micrometers.
