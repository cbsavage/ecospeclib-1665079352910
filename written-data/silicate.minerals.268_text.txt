Name: Kyanite Al2SiO5
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: kyanite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Brazil (?) via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 139740)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of two blue crystals, each about 1.5 cm x 0.4 cm x 0.4 cm in size.  Both displayed a very small amount of brown coating (limonite?), which could be scraped off or picked out after initial crushing of the crystals.  Under the microscope, the resulting sample appears pure and unaltered. Particle size was Less than 2 Micrometers.(Isolated Tetrahedra); (Al2SiO5 Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.powder.kyanit1.spectrum.txt
