Origin: Magnet Cove, Arkansas via the Smithsonian (NMNH 79051-1)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was composed of one large fragment and two smaller ones, all from the same crystal.  The large fragment was 1 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm long, with the other pieces half as large.  Total weight was 7.5 g.  The sample was tan in color, with abundant (10-20%) calcite. Petrographic examination showed minor (<1%) alteration to green antigorite and a few opaque grains. Particle size was Less than 2 Micrometers.(Isolated tetrahedra); (OlivineGroup) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.montic1.spectrum.txt
