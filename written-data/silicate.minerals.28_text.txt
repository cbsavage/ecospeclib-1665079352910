Name: Pyrope Mg3Al2(SiO4)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: pyrope_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Finsch Mine, Brits Farm, 23 miles E. of Posemasburg, CapeProv., South Africa, via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 121624)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of many rounded (tumbled?) pieces about 3 mm in diameter, with a total weight of 19.3 g.  Dark maroon in color, some pieces contained a green mineral (chlorite?, uvarovite?), limonitic alteration, and a soft, thin, cream-colored coating (talc?).  These pieces (<1% of total sample) were discarded.  The remaining sample appears pure under the microscope.
