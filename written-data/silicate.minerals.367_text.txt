Name: Acmite NaFe+3Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: acmite_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Kangerdluarssuk, near Narssaq, Greenland viathe Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 133746).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of large (up to 2 cm long and almost as wide), very dark green prismatic crystals of acmite intergrown with albite.  The material was crushed and hand-picked for single crystal measurements and grinding.  The concentrate appeared pure under microscopic examination.  Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers.(Pyroxene Group - single chain) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.acmite2.spectrum.txt
