Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: labrador_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Lake County, Oregon, acquired from the Smithsonian (sampleno. NMNH 115500) via Dave Stewart, USGS
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of a 2 cm x 1 cm x 0.2 cm, 0.536 g portion, of a single transparent crystal.  The fragment seemed to have been sawn on one side.  A very, very small amount of iron oxide stain could be seen on the surface of the fragment and still less on the inside.  No impurities were detected under the microscope. Particle size was 75-250 micrometers.(Framework Silicates); (Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.labrad1.spectrum.txt
