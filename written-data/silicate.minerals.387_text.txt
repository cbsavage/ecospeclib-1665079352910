Description: The hand sample appeared entirely pure, being a clear and transparent fragment of a single crystal.  This purity was confirmed under the microscope and by XRD analysis, as well as within the limits of microprobe error. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers.(Silica Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.quartz1.spectrum.txt
