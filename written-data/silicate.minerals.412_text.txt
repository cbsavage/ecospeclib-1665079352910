Name: Olivine (Fo92) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: olivine_11
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Chavira olivine-peridot mine, near Camargo, Chihuahua,Mexico via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 137044)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of many 0.5 cm particles, green in color, appearing pure, plus one large fragment.  The large (1.3 cm x 1 cm) fragment seemed to contain much of contamination, probably diopside, and was discarded.  The hand-picked sample seemed quite clean, except for one grain of pyroxene seen under the microscope and a small amount of limonitic staining on some grains. Particle size was less than 2  Micrometers.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.olivi11.spectrum.txt
