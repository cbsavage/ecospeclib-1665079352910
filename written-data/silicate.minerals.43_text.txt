Description: The sample was a greenish, earthy clay.  The bulk sample contained quartz and illite/smectite, but the 2 micrometers particle-size separate is pure illite/smectite, with 95% illite layers.(Sheet Silicates); (MicaGroup)Particle size was 0-2 micrometers, but packed powder simulates coarse.
