Name: Illite/smectite (K,H3O)(Al,Mg,Fe)2(Si,Al)4 O10 [(OH)2,H2O]
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: illsmec_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Cameron, Arizona; from Hunt and Salisbury Collection #31(purchased from Ward's Natural Science Establishment); 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a light tan, earthy clay. Called "montmorillonite" by Ward's, the bulk sample and the less than 2 micrometers particle-size separate are pure illite/smectite, with 35% illite layers. Particle size was 0-2 micrometers, but packed powder simulates coarse.(Sheet Silicates) (Mica Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.packed.illsme1.spectrum.txt
