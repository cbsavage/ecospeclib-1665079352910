Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: clinopt_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Donated by W. J. Ehmann ;  Sample #7 from Castle Creek,Idaho. 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample is a cream-colored earthy mass.  Because of the earthy nature of this mineral sample, there is little difference between the spectra of different particle size ranges. Petrographically it is clean and pure clinoptilolite. Particle size was less than 2  Micrometers.(Framework silicates) (Zeolite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.powder.clinop1.spectrum.txt
