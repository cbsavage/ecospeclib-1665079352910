Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: sanidine_3
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Higasinuiro-gun, Taiji, Wakayama, Japan via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH 103200)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of many small (0.5 cm) euhedral crystals totaling 6.49 g.  Almost all had some adhering clay/limonite, to be removed by brushing and ultrasonic cleaning.  Under the microscope, a few acicular inclusions (rutile) could be seen.  Otherwise the sample appeared very pure. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers.(Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.powder.sanidi3.spectrum.txt
