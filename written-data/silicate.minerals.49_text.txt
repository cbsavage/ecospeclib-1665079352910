Name: Lizardite Mg3Si2O5(OH)4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: lizard_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Austria via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH R4687),acquired from Trude King, USGS.
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample was a small amount of fine white powder.  Only one anomalous grain was noted under the microscope with high birefringence (calcite or dolomite?).  (However, the infrared spectrum does not display any carbonate bands.) XRD Analysis:  Pure lizardite; sample was too small for chemical analysis. Particle size was 0-60 micrometers, but packed powder simulates coarse.(Sheet Silicates); (Serpentine/Kaoline Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.packed.lizard1.spectrum.txt
