Name: Augite (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: augite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Monteagle Township, Hostings Co., Ontario,Canada via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 117461). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of  fragments of well-formed crystal(s), with some surface contamination by calcite.  Small grains were deep, translucent green and generally clear and unaltered.  The powdered sample was washed in dilute HCl to remove residual calcite, but an extremely weak carbonate band is still seen in the spectrum of the 75-250 micrometers size range near 4.0 micrometers. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers.(Pyroxene Group - single chain) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.augite1.spectrum.txt
