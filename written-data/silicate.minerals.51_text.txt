Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: montmor_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Gonzales Co., Texas via the Hunt and Salisbury Collection(#CMS STx-1) (Purchased from the Clay Mineral Society Repository)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a white, earthy clay. The bulk sample contains calcite, but <2 micrometer size fraction used in the spectral measurements is pure montmorillonite. Particle size was 0-2 micrometers, but packed powder simulates coarse.(Sheet Silicates); (SmectiteGroup) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.packed.montmo2.spectrum.txt
