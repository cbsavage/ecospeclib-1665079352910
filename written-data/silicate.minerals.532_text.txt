Name: Pectolite NaCa2Si308(OH)
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: pectol_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Thedford, Ontario, Canada via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH 94865)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of a small (1 mm x 1 mm x 1 cm ) and one larger (5 mm x 6 mm x 1 cm) fragment. Sample appears to be composed of pure pectolite needles. However, microsopic examination revealed that it contained 2% of an isotropic mineral. Fibrous pectolite precludes effective sieving; the fine fraction was separated from the coarse fraction by elutriation in acetone. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers.(Chain Silicates); (Pyrexenoid Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.pectol2.spectrum.txt
