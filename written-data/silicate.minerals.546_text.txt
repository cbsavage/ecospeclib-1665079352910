Name: Rhodonite (Mn+2,Fe+2,Mg,Ca)SiO3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: rhodon_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Franklin, New Jersey via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNHC6148)
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The hand sample was composed of two fragments, each about 2 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm. Pink rhodonite crystals were removed from host rock by sawing to free pure rhodonite. Under the petrographic microscope, many of the grains show a small degree of unidentified alteration, likely accounting for the strong hydroxyl bands near 2.7 micrometers. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers. (chain silicates); (Pyroxenoid Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.rhodon1.spectrum.txt
