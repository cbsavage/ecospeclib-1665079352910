Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: South Point, Hawaii via Trude King #GSB
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Samples of olivine from an olivine sand beach were optically examined using a petrographic microscope prior to spectral measurements to insure purity of the olivine.  The sample was >98% pure olivine.  It was hand ground and wet sieved into <60 micrometers size range.  Sample preparation was by Trude King, USGS, Denver. Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers. (Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.olivin9.spectrum.txt
