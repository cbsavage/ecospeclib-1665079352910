Name: Wollastonite CaSiO3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: wollasto_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Santa Fe Mine, Pichucalco, Chiapas, Mexico via theSmithsonian (sample no. NMNH 131913)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of a 2 cm x 1 cm x 0.5 cm well-formed crystal  and one large 4 cm x 1 cm x 0.5 cm piece, both gray in color.  One surface of the large piece was dirty and had sulfide inclusions, which were separated by crushing and hand picking.  Under the microscope, some grains showed a little alteration and inclusions or voids along cleavage directions. Particle size was 75 - 250 Micrometers.(Chain Silicates); (Pyroxenoid Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.wollast1.spectrum.txt
