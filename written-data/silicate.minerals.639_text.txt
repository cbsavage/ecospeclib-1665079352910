Description: The sample is a cream-colored earthy mass.  Because of the earthy nature of this mineral sample, there is little difference between the spectra of different particle size ranges. Petrographically it is clean and pure clinoptilolite. Sample was random surface.(Framework silicates) (Zeolite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.solid.clinop1.spectrum.txt
