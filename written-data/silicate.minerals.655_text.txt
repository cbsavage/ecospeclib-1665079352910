Description: The sample consisted of many small (0.5 cm) euhedral crystals totaling 6.49 g.  Almost all had some adhering clay/limonite, to be removed by brushing and ultrasonic cleaning.  Under the microscope, a few acicular inclusions (rutile) could be seen.  Otherwise the sample appeared very pure. Sample had cleavage face.(Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.solid.sanidi3.spectrum.txt
