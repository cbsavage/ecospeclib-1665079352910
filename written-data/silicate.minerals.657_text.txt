Description:  The hand sample was a large chunk of vivid blue sodalite that appeared quite pure. Microscopic examination showed about 2% contamination with either a colorless mineral with 1 degreeyellow birefringence, or another colorless mineral with slight brownish staining, 2 degrees birefringence, and 2 directions of cleavage. One observed contaminant was a carbonate. Sample had fracture surface.
