Sample No.: zoisite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Arusha, Tanzania via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH126029)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of five euhedral, violet-blue crystals, with some clay material and mica adhering to a few surfaces.  Each crystal was about 7 mm x 10 mm, with a total weight of 5.9 g.  After removal of the coating material and crushing, microscopic examination showed about 1% brown alteration material, but otherwise the sample appeared pure. Particle size was 001 cleavage face.
