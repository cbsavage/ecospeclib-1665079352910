Name: Hornblende Ca2(Fe+2,Mg)4Al(Si7Al)O22(OH,F)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: hornblen_3
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Calumet Island, Ottowa River, Canada via the Smithsaonian(sample no. NMNH 78662)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample was a cluster of several large, deep green crystals. A small amount of contamination was found in thin veins along cleavage planes. Microscopic examination revealed newr purity with less than 1% impurities of low index veins. An index of refraction of <1.64 and pleochroism (green to greenish brown) indicated that this is probably magnesian hornblende. Particle size was Less than 2 micrometers.
