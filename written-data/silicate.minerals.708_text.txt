Name: Hypersthene (Mg,Fe+2)2Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: hypersth_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Western Greenland, via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNHC2368).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Black in color; a small amount of surface contamination was removed; some mineral inclusions were separated from the remainder of the sample after crushing.  Under the microscope, the sample was green-brown pleochroic, with a high index of refraction.  It appeared mildly altered with some (2%) iron-stained opaque material present. Particle size was Less than 2 micrometer. (Pyroxene Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.powder.hypers1.spectrum.txt
