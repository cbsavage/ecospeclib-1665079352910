Name: Richterite Na2Ca(Mg,Fe+2)5Si8O22(OH)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: richter_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Wilberforce, Ontario, Canada via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH 150800)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of two large (6.49 and 6.45 g) pieces and 2 smaller fragments, black in color. All fragments were parts of single crystals. One fragment had significant calcite contamination; all fragments had about 1% contamination with small blotchy inclusions of calcite. The crushed sample was treated with HCl, after which all grains appeared pure under the microscope. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers. (chain silicates); (Amphibole Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.powder.richte1.spectrum.txt
