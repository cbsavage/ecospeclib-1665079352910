Subclass: Cyclosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: beryl_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Maine via Hunt and Salisbury Collection sample#180B (purchased from Ward's Natural Science Establishment).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The hand sample was cut and polished along an unknown axis.  It was pale green and appeared pure.  Microscopic examination showed a small amount (2% or less) of very fine, low birefringent material in the sample.  The contaminating grains occasionally have rhombic or cubic shape.  These grains were unidentifiable. Particle size was Less than 2 Micrometers.
