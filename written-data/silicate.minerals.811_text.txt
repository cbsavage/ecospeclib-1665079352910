Name: Cordierite Mg2Al4Si5O18
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Cyclosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: cordier_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Orijarvi, Finland via the Smithsonian  (sampleno. NMNH 78228). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consists of three pieces, each about 2 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm.  There are some heterogeneities in color, but the samples are predominantly blue-gray.  They appear fairly pure, but do have a few veins with discoloration along them.  Under the petrographic microscope all samples appear to be cordierite, but grains have a small amount of alteration and some microcrystalline inclusions. Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Ring Silicates) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.cyclosilicate.powder.cordie2.spectrum.txt
