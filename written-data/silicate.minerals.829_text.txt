Name: Bustamite (Mn,Ca)3Si3O9
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: bustamite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Smithsonian NMNH R3099 Sample from Franklin, New Jersey.
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The sample was a prismatic piece about 3 cm in length and 1-2 cm wide. It appeared pure except for a few grains of calcite that were removed. Under the petrographic microscope about 2% of grains show some light alteration.  The portion chosen for probe analysis was comprised of clean, homogeneous grains.  The sample was treated with acetic acid to remove any remaining calcite.
