Name: Diopside CaMgSi2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: diopside_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from St. Lawrence Co., New York via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH C2393).  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of two green subhedral crystals 1-2 cm in length and width. Both crystals appeared pure in hand specimen.  Under the petrographic microscope, the powdered sample displayed one small, moderately birefringent grain with parallel extinction. There may be minor exsolution. Very little alteration, but a trace amount (<< 1%) of sericite can be seen along cleavage planes. Sample was 110 crystal face.
