Name: Hedenbergite CaFe+2Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: hedenber_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Eureka Mine, 2nd Level, Sub-level 1, 135 N, 645E, Ducktown,Tennesse, via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 119197)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was made up of three large pieces and three small fragments, weighing altogether about 28 g.  All pieces are deep green and parts of single crystals.  They display a very small amount of veining.  Surfaces of the pieces have a veneer of contamination Ñprobably the same as the veining.  There is also an extremely small amount of sulphide contamination.
