Name: Tremolite Ca2(Mg, Fe+2)5Si8O22(OH)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: tremol_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Canada via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 117611)
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The sample consisted of a single 21.41 g piece of euhedral crystal, translucent deep brown in color. A very small amount of calcite contamination was removed with HCl.  Microscopic examination showed the sample to be virtually all pure, clean tremolite, with a very small amount (<1%) of low efractive index impurity. Sample had cleavage face.
