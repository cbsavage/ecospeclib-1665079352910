Name: Olivine (Fo11) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: olivine_10
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Twin Sisters Peak, Washington via Trude King #TSD
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Olivine from the Twin Sisters intrusive was optically examined using a petrographic icroscope prior to spectral measurements to insure purity of the olivine.  The sample was >98% pure olivine.  It was hand ground and wet sieved into <60 µm size range.  Particle size was 0-60 micrometers, but packed powder simulates coarse. Sample preparation was by Trude King, USGS, Denver.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.packed.olivi10.spectrum.txt
