Name: Olivine (Fo88) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: olivine_8
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Brenham, Kansas (location of meteorite fall) via Trude King#10L (from the Center for Meteorite Studies, Arizona St. University)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Olivine obtained from the Brenham meteorite was optically examined using a petrographic microscope prior to spectral measurements to insure purity of the olivine.  Olivine then hand ground and wet sieved to less than 30 micrometers.  Sample preparation by Trude King, USGS, Denver. Particle size was 0-30 micrometers, but Packed powder simulates coarse.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.packed.olivin8.spectrum.txt
