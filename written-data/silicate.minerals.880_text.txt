Name: Olivine (Fo92) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: olivine_13
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Rockport, Massachusetts via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH R3517)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a large black fragment. Millimeter-wide serpentine veins traversed the sample, which were discarded during initial sample crushing. Finer veins and light iron staining were too abundant to remove. Microscopic examination showed contamination by 1% magnetite inclusions and <1% limonitic material. The fayalite itself also seems to contain fluid inclusions. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers. (Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.coarse.olivi13.spectrum.txt
