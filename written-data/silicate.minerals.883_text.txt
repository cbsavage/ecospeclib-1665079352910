Name: Olivine (Fo41) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: olivine_4
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Kiglapait Intrusion, Labrador via Trude King #KI4143(obtained from S.A. Morse, Univ. of Mass.)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Initially, the specimen was contaminated with pyroxene, spinel (?) and ilmenite.  Heavy liquid separation, followed by magnetic separation and hand picking, allowed olivines of different iron content to be solated.  The sample was ground to <60 micrometers and wet sieved.  Fine particles are missing from the sample; average particle size is close to 60 micrometers. Particle size was 0-60 micrometers, but Packed powder simulates coarse.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group)  Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.packed.olivin4.spectrum.txt
