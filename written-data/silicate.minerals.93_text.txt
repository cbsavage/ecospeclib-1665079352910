Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: smectite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Grant Co., Washington, USA via the Clay Mineral SocietySource Clay Mineral Repository #CMS SWa-1
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  Described by CMS as a ferruginous smectite, the sample was a brown, earthy clay. The less than 2 micrometers size fraction is pure Fe-smectite (probably nontronite).  The larger size fraction contains a small amount of quartz and was discarded.Particle size was 0-2 micrometers and sample was packed powder simulates coarse.(Sheet silicates); Smectite Group Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.packed.smecti1.spectrum.txt
